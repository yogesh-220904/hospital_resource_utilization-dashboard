# Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital operations, resource utilization, patient outcomes, and cost efficiency across a multi-branch hospital network.

## Problem Statement
Hospital administrators require visibility into admissions, length of stay, emergency load, staffing utilization, and outcomes to support operational decisions and long-term capacity planning.

## Solution
The dashboard is structured into three analytical layers:
1. Executive Overview
2. Operations & Bottleneck Analysis
3. Planning & Branch Comparison

## Repository Structure
- data/ → Synthetic anonymized dataset
- dashboard/ → Power BI (.pbix) dashboard file
- report/ → Final project report and supporting material

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel (Synthetic Dataset)
- Conceptual ETL using FastAPI
- PostgreSQL (assumed on-prem storage)

## Notes
The dataset used in this project is synthetic and anonymized. Dashboard interactivity is demonstrated via a public walkthrough due to Power BI Service tenant restrictions.
